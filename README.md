# Business Communication: curl snippets

These code snippets demonstrate how to perform operations with the Business Communications API using curl from the command line.

This project contains multiple examples. Each file contains a single operation with the Business Communications API.

To run the curl commands you need to be signed up with [Business Messages](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register).

The documentation for the Business Communications API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/reference/business-communications/rest).

## Prerequisite

You must have the following software installed on your machine:

- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html)
